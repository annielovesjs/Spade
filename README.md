# Spade
An untraceable, self-destructing chat app but with features to guarantee anonymity and privacy

No account needed, just enter a random username and create a chat! A unique chat room is generated for every chat you create so you can join someone else's chat by using the code they send you

# Features
ESC - quickly clears the chat content on your screen
help# - get list of possible commands 
wipe# - your chat's been compromised? Delete the chat content for every single person in your chat so no one can access the previous messages
s# - locks your chat room (for when you don't want anyone to see your messages but you want to be able to access it)

When you close the tab or chatbox, you won't be able to see previous msgs again. If everyone leaves the room, there will be no records of the chat ever existing (hence, a burner chat)

# Demo
[coming soon]
